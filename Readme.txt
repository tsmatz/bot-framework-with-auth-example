This solution is a super super simple bot sample code which is integrated with the OAuth autehntication.
Note that, because we want to show you the core logic (the code which shows how to integrate the authentication), this sample doesn't implement the several security code.
Please add the security code for your production.
(Please see the source code comment.)
